After the motion came to light, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=TSLA\">Tesla’s shares</a> lost as much as 5 percent of their $298.77 market-close value in after-hours trading. The price crept back to somewhere around its previous level overnight, however, as traders digested the news.</p>\n",

       "<p>Under the terms of last year’s agreement, Musk was supposed to have all of his Twitter comments pre-approved by Tesla’s designated representative if they touched upon “information material to the company or its shareholders.”</p>\n",
       "\n",
       "<p>That provision was meant to head off tweets like the one that Musk sent out last August, claiming that he had “funding secured” to take Tesla private even though that wasn’t actually the case. That claim and its aftermath sparked wild gyrations in the market, leading the SEC to open its fraud investigation.</p>\n",
       "\n",
       "<p>The agreement also required Musk to step down from his post as Tesla’s chairman and pay a $20 million fine. Tesla was also fined $20 million, and was forced to appoint two new independent directors to its board.</p>\n",
       "\n",
       "<p>The seeming resolution of the SEC case, plus Tesla’s <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2018/tesla-posts-historic-quarterly-report-positive-net-income-cash-flow/\">profit-generating increase in production for its Model 3 electric car</a>, sent Tesla’s share price as high as $376.

       "<p>Next, another call from dispatch: An older woman with a terminal cancer diagnosis has called in, concerned about a reaction to her chemotherapy. The house is about 20 minutes away. They head off to check on the woman.</p>\n",
       "\n",
       "<p>It’s all in a night’s work for Nillesen and Henry. “It’s a little different than what you do during the day,” says Nillesen, whose regular general practitioner practice is about 15 minutes outside Nijmegen.</p>\n",
       "\n",
       "<p>Nillesen’s shift, which she does a couple of times a month, is part of a bigger general practitioner cooperative that provides after-hours care. There are others like it all over the country. The co-op is the main reason Dutch patients are more likely than patients almost anywhere else in the world to say they can get care after business hours if they need it.</p>\n",
       "\n",
       "<p>The co-op is a microcosm of health care in the Netherlands: a complicated machine with many moving parts, providers working in concert to deliver medical care to their patients. The Netherlands leans on private actors — private insurers, independently employed doctors, privately owned nonprofit hospitals — to provide health care. But it also places strict regulations on the health sector to achieve the goals of affordability and access. That balance of market principles and close government regulation has created a health care system that seems to work well for the Dutch.</p>\n",

       "<p><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/1/13/21055327/everybody-covered\">Vox is looking abroad</a> for lessons about how to achieve universal and affordable health care. We wanted to understand the choices other countries made and the consequences of those decisions. No health care system is perfect. But America’s economic peers have figured out a way to deliver truly universal coverage and quality care. Our project, <a href=\"http://www.vox.com/covered\">Everybody Covered</a>, was made possible by a grant from <a href=\"https://www.commonwealthfund.org/about-us\">The Commonwealth Fund</a>.</p>\n",

       "<p>The Netherlands has built one of the highest-quality health care systems in the world, ranking third globally on one measure: <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/action/showFullTableHTML?isHtml=true&amp;tableId=tbl2&amp;pii=S0140-6736%2818%2930994-2\">a quality and access index</a> on avoiding preventable deaths.</p>\n",
       "\n",
       "<p>The Dutch might have a reputation as libertine progressives, with a relaxed attitude to drugs and legalized prostitution, but their history is deeply rooted in capitalism too: The country was the mercantile center of the world during the 1600s. In their health system, they have tried to build an idealized version of managed competition, the same ethos that has informed US health care reforms from health maintenance organizations in the 1980s to the Affordable Care Act.</p>\n",
       "\n",
       "<p>Managed competition uses a combination of private markets and government regulations to try to reduce health care costs and improve the quality of care. The Netherlands strives to have the different parts of its system — the general practitioners, private insurers, home nurses, the emergency department — work together seamlessly. The Dutch have sought to use a tightly managed market to achieve universal health care, rather than a more socialized system like those seen elsewhere in Europe.</p>\n",
       "\n",
       "<p>Take the after-hours co-ops: Almost every Dutch general practitioner participates in one, but the co-op was their idea in the first place. It allows doctors to share the responsibility for after-hours care, rather than every doctor offering the service 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year.</p>\n",
       "\n",
       "<p>That’s how it used to be. Nillesen remembers her dad, also a family physician, staying home every night in case one of his patients called. Her family couldn’t take more than one week of vacation in a year; even then, her dad needed to persuade another doctor to cover his patient calls.</p>\n",

       "<p>Not all parts of the system fulfill the cooperative ideal so well. Primary care doctors, the gatekeepers through which the whole system flows, sometimes feel strained.

       "\n",
       "<p>Still, for now, the indicators seem undeniable: The Netherlands is among the world’s elite in the quality of the health care its citizens receive — and basically everyone is covered. The system demonstrates that if a country is committed to organizing and tightly managing its health care, then it is still possible to achieve universal, affordable, and accessible care without entirely sacrificing market principles or private insurance.</p>\n",

       "<p>Democrats in the United States who support Medicare-for-all want to take a fractured and stratified health care system and make it more unified and equitable through nationalized health insurance.</p>\n",
       "\n",
       "<p>The Netherlands saw the same problems in the mid-2000s, but they came up with a different fix.</p>\n",
       "\n",
       "<p>Before then, the country had a two-tiered health care system: About two-thirds of the country was covered by a social health insurance program, and the remaining third was covered by private insurance. Disparities developed between the two tiers; wealthier people got better access to doctors with their private coverage.</p>\n",
       "\n",
       "<p>By 2006, the two-tiered system teetered on the brink. Health care was becoming very expensive for the middle class, who faced high out-of-pocket costs. Yet private insurance was more attractive to doctors, because it paid better, than the public program that was covering people with lower incomes. And about 2 percent of the population still lacked insurance.</p>\n",
       "\n",
       "<p>So the Dutch decided to overhaul their health insurance. The ruling center-right government compromised on a program to achieve universal coverage, which both sides agreed was essential, without abandoning the private market.</p>\n",
       "\n",
       "<p>“There was a window of opportunity. The old system had really hit a wall,” Patrick Jeurissen, a health policy professor at Radboud University in Nijmegen, told me.</p>\n",

       "<p>Their solution: Everybody would have to purchase private health insurance individually, through a strongly regulated market. The public program would disappear. The Dutch system’s rules presaged the rules in the Affordable Care Act on preexisting conditions: guaranteed issue (nobody could be denied health insurance because of their medical history), community rating (nobody could be charged higher premiums for their health status), and an individual mandate (everyone must carry insurance or pay a penalty).</p>\n",
       "\n",
       "<p>The Netherlands fines people who don’t carry insurance for up to six months and then auto-enrolls them in an insurance plan, with premiums that are about 20 percent higher than they would have paid if they signed up during the regular enrollment period. A small number of people — about 200,000, or around 1 percent of the population — default on their premiums, and their wages are garnished to cover the cost of their insurance.</p>\n",

People with lower incomes get additional government assistance to reduce their payments. The government also collects contributions from employers to help fund the insurance scheme and covers the cost for children; revenues are spread among the insurers based on the health status of their customers. Public financing covers about 75 percent of the system’s costs; the insurers have also generally operated as nonprofits.</p>\n",
       "\n",
       "<p>The benefits are designed to encourage cost-efficient use of medical care by patients. Dutch patients can visit a primary care doctor for free. For a visit to the hospital, they will need to pay toward their deductible. <a href=\"https://www.studenten-zorgverzekeringen.nl/en/basic-healthcare-insurance.html\">The annual deductible</a> is today capped at €385 ($429), although people can choose to pay a lower monthly premium in exchange for a higher deductible — up to €885 ($980). That is still well below the typical deductible in America (<a href=\"https://www.kff.org/health-costs/press-release/benchmark-employer-survey-finds-average-family-premiums-now-top-20000/\">more than $1,600 on average</a> for workers on their employer’s plan, and many people have a higher deductible than that).</p>\n",

       "\n",
       "<p>The Dutch ethos of smartly managed health care extends beyond just the provision of health insurance. Doctors and hospitals are tightly regulated, too.</p>\n",

Insurers can set a cap on how much will be paid out for medical services provided in a given year, known as a global budget, and the government can impose budget cuts if spending goes over that limit. Almost every hospital is a nonprofit. Specialists are self-employed. Primary care doctors have historically had solo practices as well, though some of them have started to consolidate into clinics with several doctors on the same masthead. Dutch insurance plans create provider networks by contracting with certain doctors and hospitals, and Jeurissen even said that through court rulings, it’s been established that Dutch patients can only be charged, at most, 20 percent of the cost for out-of-network care.</p>\n",
       "\n",
       "<p>The strict rules facilitate simple solutions to problems like after-hours care. Every insurer pays primary care doctors the same flat rate, $75 an hour, for care at the general practitioner co-ops. No one insurer’s patients get preference over another.</p>\n",

       "\n",
       "<p>To start, it’s much smaller, and it’s one of the most densely populated countries in the world, although some American health providers have seen some potential in the model: Researchers led by Paul Giesen from Radboud University, who served as guides for Vox on our visit, consulted with a Minnesota hospital in 2016 on its program. (The project didn’t get off the ground.)</p>\n",
       "\n",
       "<p>The general practitioner co-ops — a group of privately practicing physicians coming together to deliver better after-hours care, within a well-organized structure — epitomize the Dutch ethos of collaboration in a private health care market. The co-ops divvy up the country so that each one is responsible for a few thousand patients. Doctors from the smaller villages team up to deliver the service. A map I saw of the co-ops’ territory looks like overlapping spiderwebs spread out over the country.</p>\n",

       "<p>For her after-hours shifts, Nillesen is based out of Canisius Wilhelmina Ziekenhuis, one of the two major hospitals in Nijmegen, this city of 171,000 people near the border with Germany. Three doctors are on call on the Wednesday night I visit. Nillesen handles the home visits. Another takes charge of the in-person clinic. The third leads the call center, where six nurses take inquiries from patients who call the hotline number. Once the lines open at 5 pm, every nurse is on the phone within minutes.</p>\n",

Aloys and Ingrid will do home visits during office hours, to visit the elderly and disabled patients on their rosters.

       "<p>On May 2, 2001, almost every Dutch doctor went on strike for three days because the government was refusing to provide support for the after-hours program despite pleas from its originator Giesen and others about the necessity of preventing burnout among their peers.</p>\n",
       "\n",
       "<p>So the doctors sent all their patients to the emergency department instead, and physicians protested in the streets of the Hague. It took less than 72 hours for the government to relent, as emergency rooms across the country quickly became overcrowded.</p>\n",
       "\n",
       "<p>Although the Dutch pride themselves on solidarity and collaboration, sometimes dramatic action has been necessary to make desperately needed improvements to the health care system.</p>\n",
       "\n",
       "<p>“Sometimes, we need for change a revolution,” Giesen says. “We said it’s for the whole community. It’s very important. Nowadays, people are very satisfied.”</p>\n",
       "\n",
       "<p>In the Netherlands, the status quo can be a powerful force against change, just as it is in the United States. And there is more work to be done.</p>\n",
       "\n",
       "<p>Though the Netherlands enjoys some of the best health access in the world, problems persist. Everybody I spoke with agreed on that. The point of contention was whether they are smaller problems in need of targeted fixes or more fundamental flaws in the managed competition model.</p>\n",
       "\n",
       "<p>“The consequences of managed competition — there’s no debate, everybody just accepts it,” says Gijs van Loef, a health care consultant and sociologist who has become <a href=\"https://www.skipr.nl/author/gijsvanloefskipr-nl/\">a prominent critic</a> of his country’s health care. “But the Dutch health care system has fallen off its pedestal.”</p>\n",
       "\n",
       "<p>Primary care doctors in the Netherlands deal with a lot of churn: They see patients <a href=\"https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/7/10/e017902\">for 10 minutes on average</a>, less than half the time American patients usually get to spend with their doctor, and a shorter consultation than most other Western European doctors enjoy. And they’re taking on more of the workload from specialists. Patients must get a referral from a general practitioner before they see a specialist or it won’t be covered, a change from the pre-reform era (and generally considered more cost-effective).</p>\n",

       "\n",
       "<p>“We have much more medical problems and we don’t have time anymore to do the primary health care for mother and child,” Ingrid says. “We have much more things to do in our practice nowadays, so we don’t have room or time for extra tasks.”</p>\n",

That has left the lower middle class in particular paying more of their income toward health care than in the years before. They receive assistance from the government, but it hasn’t been growing enough to keep up with rising rates.</p>\n",
       "\n",
       "<p>The deductibles required under the Dutch model can also be burdensome for people in poverty, though some cities have set up programs that cover health insurance for those people with no cost-sharing. Doctors in the Netherlands <a href=\"https://www.commonwealthfund.org/sites/default/files/documents/___media_files_publications_fund_report_2017_jul_schneider_mirror_mirror_2017_appendices.pdf\">are much more likely</a> than doctors in other European countries to say patients struggle to pay their out-of-pocket costs. There are arguably more inequities in the Netherlands than you see in systems with one national health insurance plan.</p>\n",

There is a fledgling critique from the left and others in the Netherlands arguing that managed competition will ultimately drive costs up while having a marginal or even deleterious effect on quality.</p>\n",

       "<p>Gijs van Loef is a proponent of this view. He argues that managed competition is an oxymoron — that market competition and social collaboration are fundamentally at odds. He cites those rising costs and the Netherlands’ middling performance on life expectancy compared to its European peers. Is this what people are paying for?</p>\n",

Dutch hospitals spend <a href=\"https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/full/10.1377/hlthaff.2013.1327\">20 percent</a> of their budgets on administration — less than the United States, but more than the United Kingdom or Canada, which have public health insurance.</p>\n",

       "<p>The Dutch system is, like all other health systems, a product of its country’s history. A conservative government wanted private markets to provide health insurance to its people. They wanted competition but they also wanted collaboration. That was the ethos of managed competition.</p>\n",
       "\n",
       "<p>The Netherlands has set up a system built on market precepts that outpaces most others in the world when it comes to the quality of its health care. But there are concerns about the cost Dutch patients are asked to pay, compared to people in more socialized systems.</p>\n",

       "<p>“I would never, never recommend that a country that has single-payer all of a sudden introduce multi-payer competition,” Ewout van Ginneken, a health researcher in Berlin who has studied the Dutch and other European health systems, says.</p>\n",
       "\n",
       "<p>But the collaborative spirit does persist here, even with private insurance. That’s most apparent in the after-hours program, a success story that has led to better health care and happier patients. After-hours care is a problem that few countries have succeeded in cracking. Even in highly developed economies, half of patients or more will say they have trouble seeing a doctor outside of regular business hours. But it’s a problem the Dutch appear to have solved.</p>\n",

After her third call for the night, the terminal cancer patient with an unusual reaction to her chemotherapy, it seems like Nillesen might finally catch a break. But it’s not to be. The fourth call comes over the radio. She’s off again, racing to the next patient who needs her.</p>\n",
