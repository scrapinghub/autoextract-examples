(Musk was found <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/elon-musk-pedo-guy-tweet-did-not-defame-brit-jury-rules/\">not liable for damages</a> on Dec. 6.) And don't forget the<a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1026872652290379776\"> infamous 2018 tweet</a> where he mused he might take Tesla private, which led to the SEC <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/sec-sues-elon-musk-seeks-his-removal-from-tesla/\">filing a lawsuit against him</a> (it was <a href=\"https://www.cnet.com/news/teslas-elon-musk-settles-with-sec-is-out-as-board-chairman-will-pay-20-million/\">later settled</a> and he had to pay $20 million -- pricey tweet).</p>\n\n<p>But Musk's less serious tweets garner attention, too. Sometimes, it's almost hard to believe a billionaire businessman is the one behind the keyboard. He retweets memes and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1102350927271346176\">jams to Bob Marley</a>. He makes <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1173872132880662528\">Star Wars references</a> and ruminates on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1113536956007211008\">multi-colored squirrels</a>. He responds to regular Joe tweeters and pokes fun at his fellow moguls (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1126686813840535552\">Jeff Bezos</a>, for one). Sometimes he's funny, sometimes he's sharp-tongued. But don't think for a moment he doesn't know what he's doing. In 2018, Musk <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/tesla-ceo-elon-musk-the-2018-60-minutes-interview/\">told Lesley Stahl of 60 Minutes</a> that \"Twitter's a war zone. If somebody's gonna jump in the war zone, it's, like, 'OK, you're in the arena. Let's go!'\"</p>\n\n<p>\"I was always crazy on Twitter fyi,\" he wrote in April, following up with, \"My Twitter is pretty much complete nonsense at this point.\"</p>\n\n<figure><blockquote data-conversation=\"none\"><p dir=\"ltr\">I was always crazy on Twitter fyi</p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1117641451008081922?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 15, 2019</a></blockquote></figure>\n\n<figure><blockquote><p dir=\"ltr\">My Twitter is pretty much complete nonsense at this point</p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1119093220544147457?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">April 19, 2019</a></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p>Musk may be the founder of The Boring Company, but he himself is never boring.

This one was liked more than 461,000 times in less than a day.</p>\n\n<h2>Life as a video game</h2>\n\n<p>\"If life is a video game, the graphics are great, but the plot is confusing &amp; the tutorial is way too long,\" Musk mused on Thursday. He's not wrong! But the question remains: Is the game more like The Sims, or straight-up Doom?</p>\n\n<figure><blockquote><p dir=\"ltr\">If life is a video game, the graphics are great, but the plot is confusing &amp; the tutorial is way too long</p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1205030950750412800?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 12, 2019</a></blockquote></figure>\n\n<h2>Nuke Mars!</h2>\n\n<figure><blockquote><p dir=\"ltr\">Nuke Mars!</p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1162218267932446724?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 16, 2019</a></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p>In 2015, Musk <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2015/09/11/us/elon-musk-mars-nuclear-bomb-colbert-feat/index.html\">appeared on The Late Show With Stephen Colbert</a> and suggested \"warming up\" the Red Planet by dropping thermonuclear weapons on its poles. Colbert thought that made Musk sound like a supervillain, and maybe he's right, but Musk re-iterated the sentiment in August 2019. SpaceX now sells <a href=\"https://shop.spacex.com/products/nuke-mars-t-shirt\">\"Nuke Mars\" T-shirts</a>, too.</p>\n\n<h2>Go metric</h2>\n\n<figure><blockquote><p dir=\"ltr\">Some secrets are too dangerous to be free <a href=\"https://t.co/g547UdmiJ7\">pic.twitter.com/g547UdmiJ7</a></p>— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1176530527290941441?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 24, 2019</a></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p>America tried, limply, to go metric in the 1970s, but it didn't work out.

Makes Teslas? This version of Musk could pick up a Tesla and carry it around one-handed.</p>\n\n<h2>Tesla blows</h2>\n\n<p>After tweeting that \"Tesla is going to develop a quiet, electric leafblower,\" Musk thought of a joke on his own company and couldn't resist sharing it. \"Tesla blows haha,\" he wrote.
