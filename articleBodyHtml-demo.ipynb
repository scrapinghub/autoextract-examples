    "### Removing pull quotes\n",
    "[Pull quotes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pull_quote) are being used very often in\n",
    "articles these days. A pull quote is an **excerpt** of the article content **which is repeated**\n",
    "within the article **but highlighted** with a different format (i.e appearing in its own box and using a bigger font).\n",
    "A pair or examples\n",
    "can be seen in [this page](https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/2020/1/15/20863236/chris-hughes-break-up-facebook-economic-security-basic-income-new-republic). \n",
    "\n",
    "Pull quotes are a nice formatting element, but it might be better to strip them out if we are converting the document to plain text because having repeated content should be avoided here: formatting is lost in raw text \n",
    "and therefore pull quotes are not useful but disturbing for the reader. The attribute `articleBody` already contains a text version of the article, but pull quotes are not removed there. In the following example, we are\n",
    "going to convert the article to raw text but excluding all pull quotes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that AutoExtract detect quotes using machine learning techniques and returns\n",
    "them in `articleBodyHtml` under `blockquote` tags. "
